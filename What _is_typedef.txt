typedef : It is a reserved keyword to create an additional name for 
          another datatype and pointer to a more meaningfull name. New 
          identifier for an existing type helps with readability and rudece 
          typos. Typedefs allow you to give descriptive names to standard 
          data types, which can also help you self-document your code.
          we can also use typedef with the help of 'using' keyword.
